      <h4>Alice, 5 stars</h4>

        The Mavericks panel truck was a perfect choice for my solo road trip.
        Compact, easy to drive, and had all the essentials. The kitchen
        facilities were sufficient, and the overall experience was fantastic.

      <h4>Bob, 3 stars</h4>
      <p>
        A decent option for solo travel. The Mavericks provided a comfortable
        stay, but the lack of bathroom facilities was a drawback. Good for short
        trips where simplicity is preferred.
